 * \file  vec_int512_ppc.h
 * \brief Header package containing a collection of multiple precision
 * quadword integer computation functions implemented with 128-bit
 * PowerISA VMX and VSX instructions.
 *
 * PVECLIB vec_int128_ppc.h provides the 128x128-bit multiply and
 * 128-bit add with carry/extend operations. This is most of what we
 * need to implement multiple precision integer computation.
 * This header builds on those operations to build 256x256, 512x128,
 * 512x512, 1024x1024 and 2048x2048 multiplies. We also provide 512-bit
 * add with carry/extend operations as a general aid to construct
 * multiple quadword precision arithmetic.
 *
 * We provide static inline implementations for up to 512x512
 * multiplies and 512x512 add with carry/extend.
 * These in-line operations are provided as building blocks for
 * coding implementations of larger multiply and sum operations.
 * Otherwise the in-line code expansion is getting too large for
 * normal coding. So we also provide callable (static and dynamic)
 * library implementations as well
 * (\ref i512_libary_issues_0_0).
 *
 * \section i512_security_issues_0_0 Security related implications
 *
 * The challenge is delivering a 2048x2048 bit multiply, producing a
 * 4096-bit product, while minimizing cache and timing side-channel
 * exploits. The goal is to minimize the memory visibility of
 * intermediate products and sums and internal conditional logic
 * (like early exit optimizations). The working theory is to use
 * vector registers and operations and avoid storing intermediate
 * results. This implies:
 * - While the final 4096-bit product is so large (32 quadwords),
 *   it requires a memory buffer for the result, we should not use
 *   any part of this buffer to hold intermediate partial sums.
 * - The 2048-bit multiplicands are also large (2 x 16 quadwords) and
 *   will be passed in memory buffers that are effectively constant.
 * - All intermediate partial products and sums should be held
 *   in vector registers (VSRs) until quadwords of the final product
 *   are computed and ready to store into the result buffer.
 * - Avoid conditional logic that effects function timing based on
 *   values of the inputs or results.
 * - Internally the code can be organized as straight line code or
 *   loops, in-line functions or calls to carefully crafted leaf
 *   functions, as long as the above goals are met.
 *
 * Achieving these goals requires some knowledge of the Application
 * Binary Interface (ABI) and foibles of the Instruction Set
 * Architecture (PowerISA) and how they impact what the compiler can
 * generate. The compiler itself has internal strategies (and foibles)
 * that need to be managed as well.
 *
 * \subsection i512_security_issues_0_0_0 Implications of the ABI
 *
 * The computation requires a number of internal temporary vectors
 * in addition to the inputs and outputs.
 * The Power Architecture, 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification
 * (AKA the ABI) places some generous but important restrictions on
 * how the compiler generates code (and how compliant assembler code
 * is written).
 * - Up to 20 volatile vector registers v0-v19 (VSRs vs32-vs51) of which
 * 12 can be used for function arguments/return values.
 *  - Up to 12 vector arguments are passed in vector registers v2-v13
 * (VSRs vs34-vs45).
 *  - Longer vector argument lists are forced into the callers
 *  parameter save area (Stack pointer +32).
 *  - Functions can return a 128-bit vector value or a homogeneous
 *  aggregate of up to 8 vector values in vector registers v2-v9
 *  (VSRs 34-41).
 *  - Wider (8 x vectors) function return values are returned in
 *  memory via a reference pointer passed as a hidden parameter in GPR 3.
 * - Up to 12 additional non-volatile vector registers v20-v31 (vs51-vs63).
 * Any non-volatile registers must be saved before use and restored
 * before function return.
 * - The lower half for the VSRs (vs0-vs31) are prioritized for scalar
 * floating-point operations. If a function is using vectors and but
 * not scalar floating-point then the lower VSRs are available for
 * vector logical and integer operations and temporary spill from
 * vector registers.
 *  - Up to 14 volatile float double (f0-f13) or vector registers (vs0-vs13).
 *  - Up to 18 non-volatile float double (f14-f31) or vector registers (vs14-vs31).
 * - All volatile registers are a considered “clobbered” after a function call.
 *  - So the calling function must hold any local vector variables in
 *  memory or non-volatile registers if the live range extends across
 *  the function call.
 *  - In-lining the called function allows the compiler to manage
 *  register allocation across the  whole sequence. This can reduce
 *  register pressure when the called function does not actually
 *  use/modify all the volatile registers.
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_security_issues_0_0_0_0 Implications for parameter passing and Product size
 *
 * Care is required in selecting the width (256, 512-bit etc) of
 * parameter and return values. Parameters totaling more then 12 vector
 * quadwords or return values totaling more then 8 vector quadwords
 * will be spilled to the callers parameter save area. This may expose
 * intermediate partial products to cache side-channel attacks.
 * A 512x128-bit multiply returning a 640-bit product and a 512x512-bit
 * multiply returning a 1024-bit product meets this criteria (both the
 * parameters and return values fit within the ABI limits). But a
 * 1024x128-bit multiply returning 1152-bits is not OK because the
 * 1152-bit return value requires 9 vector registers, which will be
 * returned in memory.
 *
 * Also if any of these sub-functions are used without in-lining, the
 * generated code must be inspected to insure it is not spilling any
 * local variables. In my experiments with GCC 8.1 the 128x128,
 * 256x256, and 512x128 multiplies all avoid spilling. However the
 * stand-alone 512x512 implementation does require saving 3
 * non-volatile registers. This can be eliminated by in-lining the
 * 512x512 multiply into the 2048x2048 multiply function.
 *
 * \note GCC compilers before version 8 have an incomplete design for
 * homogeneous aggregates of vectors and may generate sub-optimal code
 * for these parameters.
 *
 * \subsection i512_security_issues_0_0_1 Implications of the PowerISA
 *
 * The Power Instruction Set Architecture (PowerISA) also imposes some
 * restriction on the registers vector instructions can access.
 * - The original VMX (AKA Altivec) facility has 32 vector registers
 * and instruction encoding to access those 32 registers.
 *  - This original instruction set was incorporated unchanged into
 *  the later versions of the PowerISA.
 *  - When Vector Scalar Extended facility was added, the original
 *  VMX instructions where restricted to the upper 32 VSRs
 *  (original vector registers).
 * - VSX was originally focused on vector and scalar floating-point
 * operations. With a handful of vector logical/permute/splat
 * operations added for completeness. These instructions where
 * encoded to access all 64 VSRs.
 *  - All vector integer arithmetic operations remained restricted to
 *  the upper 32 VSRs (the original VRs).
 *  - Later versions of the PowerISA (POWER8/9) added new vector
 *  integer arithmetic operations. This includes word/doubleword
 *  multiply and doubleword/quadword add/subtract. But these are also
 *  encoded to access only 32 vector registers.
 *  - The lower VSRs can still be used hold temporaries and local
 *  variables for vector integer operations.
 *
 * \subsection i512_security_issues_0_0_2 Implications for the compiler
 *
 * The compiler has to find a path though the ABI and ISA restriction
 * above while it performs:
 * - function in-lining
 * - instruction selection
 * - instruction scheduling
 * - register allocation
 *
 * For operations defined in PVECLIB, most operations are defined in
 * terms of AltiVec/VSX Built-in Functions.
 * So the compiler does not get much choice for instruction selection.
 * The PVECLIB coding style does leverage C language vector extensions
 * to load constants and manage temporary variables.
 * Using compiler Altivec/VSX built-ins and vector extensions allows
 * the compiler visibility to and control of these optimizations.
 *
 * Internal function calls effectively <I>clobber</I>
 * all (34 VSRs) volatile registers.
 * As the compiler marshals parameters into ABI prescribed VRs
 * it needs to preserve previous live content for later computation.
 * Similarly for volatile registers not used for parameter passing
 * as they are assumed to be clobbered by the called function.
 * The compiler preserves local live variables before the call by copying
 * their contents to non-volatile registers or spilling to memory.
 * This may put more <I>register pressure</I> on the available
 * non-volatile registers.
 * Small to medium sized functions often require only a fraction of
 * the available volatile registers.
 * In this case, in-lining the function avoids the disruptive volatile
 * register clobber and allows better overall register allocation.
 * So there is a strong incentive to in-line local/static functions.
 *
 * These compiler optimizations are not independent processes.
 * For example specific VSX instruction can access all 64 VSRs,
 * others are restricted to the 32 VRs
 * (like vector integer instructions).
 * So the compiler prioritizes VRs (the higher 32 VSRs)
 * for allocation to vector integer computation.
 * While the lower 32 VSRs can be used for logical/permute operations
 * and as a <I>level 1</I> spill area for VRs.
 * These restrictions combined with code size/complexity can increase
 * <I>register pressure</I> to the point the compiler is forced to
 * spill active (or live) vector registers to secondary storage.
 * This secondary storage can be:
 * - other architected registers that are available for direct
 * transfer but not usable in the computation.
 * - Local variables allocated on the stack
 * - Compiler temporaries allocated on the stack.
 *
 * Instruction scheduling can increase register pressure by moving
 * (reordering) instructions.
 * This is more prevalent when there are large differences in
 * instruction latency in the code stream.
 * For example moving independent / long latency instructions earlier
 * and dependent / short latency instructions later.
 * This tends to increase the distance between the instruction that
 * sets a register result and the next instruction the uses that
 * result in its computation.
 * The distance between a registers set and use is called the
 * <I>live range</I>.
 * This also tends to increase the number of concurrently active
 * and overlapping live ranges.
 *
 * For this specific (multi-precision integer multiply) example,
 * integer multiple and add/carry/extend instructions predominate.
 * For POWER9, vector integer multiply instructions run 7 cycles,
 * while integer add/carry/extend quadword instruction run 3 cycles.
 * The compiler will want to move the independent multiply instructions
 * earlier while the dependent add/carry instructions are moved later
 * until the latency of the (multiply) instruction
 * (on which it depends) is satisfied.
 * Moving dependent instructions apart and moving independent
 * instructions into the scheduling gap increases register pressure.
 *
 * In extreme cases, this can get out of hand.
 * At high optimization levels, the compiler can push instruction
 * scheduling to the point that it runs out of registers.
 * This forces the compiler to spill live register values,
 * splitting the live range into two smaller live ranges. Any spilled
 * values have to be reloaded later so they can used in computation.
 * This causes the compiler to generate more instructions
 * that need additional register allocation and scheduling.
 *
 * \note A 2048x2048-bit multiply is definitely an extreme case.
 * The implementation requires 256 128x128-bit multiplies,
 * where each 128x128-bit multiply requires 18-30 instructions.
 * The POWER9 implementation requires 1024 vector doublewword multiplies
 * plus 2400+ vector add/carry/extend quadword instructions.
 * When implemented as straight line code and expanded in-line
 * (<I>attribute (flatten)</I>) the total runs over 6000 instructions.
 *
 * Compiler spill code usually needs registers in addition
 * (perhaps of a different class) to the registers being spilled.
 * This can be as simple as moving to a register of the same size but
 * different class.
 * For example, register moves to/from VRs and the lower 32 VSRs.
 * But it gets more complex when spilling vector registers to memory.
 * For example, vector register spill code needs GPRs to compute stack
 * addresses for vector load/store instructions.
 * Normally this OK, unless the the spill code consumes so many GPRs
 * that it needs to spill GPRs.
 * In that case we can see serious performance bottlenecks.
 *
 * But remember that a primary goal (\ref i512_security_issues_0_0) was
 * to avoid spilling intermediate results to memory.
 * Spilling between high and low VSRs is acceptable
 * (no cache side-channel),
 * but spilling to memory must be avoided.
 * The compiler should have heuristics to back off in-lining and
 * scheduling-driven code motions just enough
 * to avoid negative performance impacts.
 * But this is difficult to model and may not handle all cases with
 * equal grace.
 * Also this may not prevent spilling VRs to memory if the compiler
 * scheduler's cost computation indicates that is an acceptable
 * trade-off.
 *
 * So we will have to directly override compiler settings and
 * heuristics to guarantee the result we want/need.
 * The PVECLIB implementation already marks most operations as
 * <B>static inline</B>.
 * But as we use these inline operations as building blocks to implement
 * larger operations we can push the resulting code size over the
 * compiler's default inline limits (<B>-finline-limit</B>).
 * Then compiler will stop in-lining for the
 * duration of compiling the current function.
 *
 * This may require stronger options/attributes to the compiler like
 * (<I>attribute (always_inline)</I>), (<I>attribute (gnu_inline)</I>),
 * or (<I>attribute (flatten)</I>).
 * The first two are not any help unless you are compiling at lower
 * optimization level (<B>-O0</B> or <B>-O1</B>). <B>-O2</B> defaults
 * to <B>-finline-small-functions</B> and <B>-O3</B> defaults to the
 * stronger <B>-finline-functions</B>.
 * However <I>attribute (flatten)</I> seems do exactly what we want.
 * Every call inside this function is in-lined unless explicitly told
 * not to (<I>attribute (noinline)</I>).
 * It seems that <I>attribute (flatten)</I> ignores the
 * <B>-finline-limit</B>.
 *
 * \note You should be compiling PVECLIB applications at <B>-O3</B> anyway.
 *
 * Now we have a large block of code for the compiler's instruction
 * scheduler to work on.
 * In this case the code is very repetitive
 * (multiply, add the column, generate carries, repeat).
 * The instruction will have lots of opportunity for scheduling long vs
 * short latency instructions and create new and longer live ranges.
 *
 * /note In fact after applying <I>attribute (flatten)</I> to
 * vec_mul2048x2048_PWR9 we see a lot of spill code. This expands
 * the code to over 9300 instructions with ~3300 instructions
 * associated with spill code.
 *
 * We need a mechanism to limit (set boundaries) on code motion
 * while preserving optimization over smaller blocks of code.
 * This is normally called a <I>compiler fence</I> but there are
 * multiple definitions so we need to be careful what we use.
 *
 * We want something that will prevent the compiler from moving
 * instructions (in either direction) across specified
 * <I>lines in the code</I>.
 *
 * We don't need an atomic memory fence
 * (like <B> __atomic_thread_fence</B> or <B>__sync_synchronize</B>)
 * that forces the processor to order loads and stores relative to a
 * specific synchronization point.
 *
 * We don't need a compiler memory fence
 * (like <B>asm ("" ::: "memory")</B>).
 * The "memory" clobber forces GCC to assume that any memory may be
 * arbitrarily read or written by the asm block.
 * So any registers holding live local variables will be forced to
 * memory before and need to be reloaded after.
 * This prevents the compiler from reordering loads, stores, and
 * arithmetic operations across it, but does not prevent the processor
 * from reordering them.
 *
 * \note POWER process have an aggressively <I>Speculative Superscalar</I>
 * design with out-of-order issue and execution.
 *
 * Neither of the above are what we want for this case.
 * We specifically want to avoid
 * memory side effects in this computation.
 * We only need the minimal compiler fence
 * (like <B>asm (";" :::)</B>)
 * that prevents the compiler from reordering any code across it
 * but does not prevent the processor from reordering them.
 *
 * By placing this compiler fence between multiply/sum stages of
 * vec_mul512x128_inline(), vec_mul512x512_inline() and
 * vec_mul2048x2048() we limit instruction scheduling and code motion
 * to smaller code blocks. This in turn reduces register pressure to
 * the point where all 64 VSRs are in use, but no spilling to stack
 * memory is required.
 *
 * \subsection i512_security_issues_0_0_3 So what does this all mean?
 *
 * The 2048x2048 multiplicands and the resulting product are so large
 * (8192-bits, 64 quadwords total) that at the outer most function the
 * inputs and the result must be in memory and passed by reference.
 * The implementation of a 2048x2048-bit multiply requires 256
 * 128x128-bit multiplies.
 * Otherwise the code can be organized into sub-functions generating
 * intermediate partial products and sums.
 *
 * Coding 256 128x128 products and generating column sums would be
 * tedious. One approach builds up products into larger and larger
 * blocks in stages. For example code a vec_mul512x128_inline()
 * operation then use that in the implementation of
 * vec_mul512x512_inline(). We also provide 512-bit add/carry/extend
 * operations to simplify generating sums of 512-bit partial products.
 * Then load blocks of 512-bits (4 quadwords,
 * 64-bytes) using vec_mul512x512_inline() to produce a 1024-bit
 * partial product (\ref i512_security_issues_0_0_0_0).
 *
 * Then multiply the 512-bit blocks across one 2048-bit (4 x 512-bit)
 * multiplicand. The completion of a 2048x512-bit partial product
 * (of 2560-bits) includes the low order 512-bits ready to store to
 * the output operand. Repeat for each 512-bit block of the other
 * 2048-bit multiplicand summing across the 512-bit columns.
 * The final sum, after the final 2048x512 partial
 * product, produces the high order 2048-bits of the 2048x2048 product
 * ready to store to the output operand.
 *
 * \note Security aware implementations could use masking
 * countermeasures associated with these load/store operations.
 * The base PVECLIB implementation does not do this.
 * The source is available in ./src/vec_int512_runtime.c.
 *
 * It is best if the
 * sub-functions code can be fully in-lined into the 2048x2048-bit
 * multiply or the sub-functions are carefully written. In this case
 * these sub-functions should be leaf-functions (does not call other
 * functions) and can execute without spilling register state or
 * requiring stored (by reference) parameters.
 *
 * All levels of implementation should
 * avoid conditional logic based on values of inputs or partial
 * products (For example early exits for leading or trailing zero
 * quadwords).
 * Doing so may expose the multiply function to timing side-channel
 * attacks. So the best case would be one large function implemented
 * as straight-line code.
 *
 * We will need all 64 VSX registers for operations and local
 * variables. So the outer function will need to allocate a
 * stack-frame and save all of the non-volatile floating point
 * registers (allowing the use of  vs14-vs31 for local vector
 * variables) and vector registers (v20-v31 AKA vs51-vs63) on
 * entry. This frees up (18+12=) 30 additional quadword registers
 * for local vector variables within the outer multiply function.
 *
 * These saved registers reflect the state of the calling (or higher)
 * function and may not have any crypto sensitive content.
 * These register save areas will not be updated with internal state
 * from the 2048x2048-bit multiply operation itself.
 *
 * The 128x128-bit vector multiply is implemented with Vector
 * Multiply-Sum Unsigned Doubleword Modulo for Power9 and Vector
 * Multiply Even/Odd Unsigned Word for Power8. The timing for vector
 * integer multiply operations are fixed at 7 cycles latency for
 * Power8/9. The sums of partial products are implemented with Vector
 * Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo/write-Carry/Extended. The timing of
 * integer add quadword operations are fixed at 4 cycles for Power8
 * and 3 cycles for Power9. The rest of the 128x128-bit multiply
 * operation is a combination of Vector Doubleword Permute Immediate,
 * Vector Shift Left Double by Octet Immediate, Vector Splats, and
 * Vector Logical Or (used as a vector register move spanning the 64
 * VSRs). All of these have fixed timings of 2 or 3 cycles.
 *
 * So the overall timing of the 2048x2048-bit multiply should be
 * consistent independent of input values. The only measurable
 * variations would be as the processor changes Simultaneous
 * Multithreading (SMT) modes (controlled by the virtual machine and
 * kernel). The SMT mode (1,2,4,8) controls each hardware thread's
 * priority to issue instructions to the core and if the instruction
 * stream is dual or single issue (from that thread's perspective).
 *
 * But the better news is that with some extra function attributes
 * (always_inline and flatten) the entire 2048x2048 multiply function
 * can be flattened into a single function of straight line code
 * (no internal function calls or conditional branches) running ~6.3K
 * instructions. And no spill code was generated for local variables
 * (no register spill within the function body).
 *
 * \section i512_Endian_issues_0_0 Endian for Multi-quadword precision operations
 *
 * As described in \ref mainpage_endian_issues_1_1
 * and \ref i128_endian_issues_0_0
 * supporting both big and little endian in a single implementation
 * has its challenges. But I think we can leave the details of
 * quadword operations to the vec_int128_ppc.h implementation.
 * The decision needed for these implementations is how the quadwords
 * of a multi-quadword integer are ordered in storage.
 * For example given an array or structure of 16 quadwords
 * representing a single 2048-bit binary number which quadword
 * contains the low order bits and which the high order bits.
 *
 * This is largely arbitrary and independent from the system endian.
 * But we should be consistent within the API defined by this header
 * and PVECLIB as a whole.
 * Placing the low order bits in the first (lowest address in memory)
 * quadword and the high order bits in last (highest address in
 * memory) quadword would be consistent with little endian.
 * While placing the high order bits in the first (lowest address in
 * memory) quadword and the low order bits in last (highest address in
 * memory) quadfword would be consistent with big endian.
 * Either is valid internal to the implementation where the key issue
 * is accessing the quadwords of the multiplicands is a convenient
 * order to generate the partial products in an order that support
 * efficient generation of column sums and carries.
 *
 * It is best for the API if the order of quadwords in multi-quadword
 * integers match the endian of the platform. This should be
 * helpful where we want the use the PVECLIB implementations
 * under existing APIs using arrays of smaller integer types.
 *
 * So on powerpc64le systems the low order quadword is the first
 * quadword. While on older powwerpc64 systems the high order quadword
 * is the first quadword. For example we can represent a 512-bit
 * integer with the following structure.
 * \code
 typedef struct
{
#if defined (PVECLIB_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
  vui128_t vx0;
  vui128_t vx1;
  vui128_t vx2;
  vui128_t vx3;
#else
  vui128_t vx3;
  vui128_t vx2;
  vui128_t vx1;
  vui128_t vx0;
#endif
} __VEC_U_512;
 * \endcode
 * In this example the field <I>vx0</I> is always the low order quadword
 * and <I>vx3</I> is always the high order quadword, independent of endian.
 * We repeat this pattern for the range of multi-quadword integer sizes
 * (from __VEC_U_256 to __VEC_U_4096) supported by this header.
 * In each case the field name <I>vx0</I> is consistently the low order
 * quadword. The field name suffix numbering continues from low to high
 * with the highest numbered field name being the high order quadword.
 *
 * \subsection i512_Endian_issues_0_0_1 Multi-quadword Integer Constants
 *
 * As we have seen, initializing larger multiple precision constants
 * an be challenging  (\ref int128_const_0_0_1).
 * The good news we can continue to to use aggregate initializers
 * for structures and arrays of vector quadwords. For example:
 *
 * \code
const __VEC_U_512 vec512_one =
    {
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000001)
    };
 * \endcode
 * This example is in the expected high to low order for the 512-bit
 * constant 1. Unfortunately endian raises it ugly head again and this
 * would a different value on little endian platform.
 *
 * So PVECLIB provides another helper macro (CONST_VINT512_Q()) to
 * provide a consistent numbericial order for multiple quadword
 * constants. For example:
 * \code
const __VEC_U_512 vec512_one = CONST_VINT512_Q
    (
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000000),
      (vui128_t) ((unsigned __int128) 0x00000001)
    );
 * \endcode
 * and
 * \code
// const for 10**128
const __VEC_U_512  vec512_ten128th = CONST_VINT512_Q
    (
      CONST_VUINT128_QxW (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x0000024e, 0xe91f2603),
      CONST_VUINT128_QxW (0xa6337f19, 0xbccdb0da, 0xc404dc08, 0xd3cff5ec),
      CONST_VUINT128_QxW (0x2374e42f, 0x0f1538fd, 0x03df9909, 0x2e953e01),
      CONST_VUINT128_QxW (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
    );

 * Unfortunately the compiler can not help with multi-quadword decimal
 * constants. So we must resort to external tools like <B>bc</B> to
 * compute large constant values and convert them to hexadecimal which
 * are easier to break into words and doubleword. These can then be
 * used a constants in program source to represent arbitrarily large
 * binary values.
 *
 * \section i512_libary_issues_0_0 Putting the Library into PVECLIB
 *
 * \todo General discussion of static and dynamic libraries should be
 * moved (eventually) to the main page. While specifics of
 * multiple quadword precision integer multiply should remain here.
 *
 * Until recently (as of v1.0.3) PVECLIB operations were
 * <B>static inline</B> only. This was reasonable as most operations
 * were small (one to a few vector instructions).
 * This offered the compiler opportunity for:
 * - Better register allocation.
 * - Identifying common subexpressions and factoring them across
 * operation instances.
 * - Better instruction scheduling across operations.
 *
 * Even then, a few operations
 * (quadword multiply, BCD multiply, BCD <-> binary conversions,
 * and some POWER8/7 implementations of POWER9 instructions)
 * were getting uncomfortably large (10s of instructions).
 * But it was the multiple quadword precision operations that
 * forced the issue as they can run to 100s and sometimes 1000s of
 * instructions.
 *
 * \subsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_0 Building Multi-platform Libraries
 *
 * Building libraries of compiled binaries is not that difficult.
 * The challenge is effectively supporting multiple processor
 * (POWER7/8/9) platforms, as many PVECLIB operations have different
 * implementations for each platform.
 * This is especially evident on the multiply integer word, doubleword,
 * and quadword operations (see; vec_muludq(), vec_mulhuq(), vec_mulluq(),
 * vec_vmuleud(), vec_vmuloud(), vec_msumudm(), vec_muleuw(),
 * vec_mulouw()).
 *
 * This is dictated by both changes in the PowerISA and in
 * the micro-architecture as it evolved across processor generations.
 * So an implementation to run on a POWER7 is necessarily restricted to
 * the instructions of PowerISA 2.06.
 * But if we are running on a POWER9, leveraging new instructions from
 * PowerISA 3.0 can yield better performance than the POWER7
 * compatible implementation. When we are dealing with larger operations
 * (10s and 100s of instructions) the compiler can schedule instruction
 * sequences based on the platform (-mtune=) for better performance.
 *
 * So we need to deliver multiple implementations for some operations
 * and we need to provide mechanisms to select a specific platform
 * implementation statically at compile/build or dynamically at
 * runtime. First we need to compile multiple version of these
 * operations, as unique functions, each with a different effective
 * target platform (-mcpu=).
 *
 * Obviously creating multiple source files implementing the same large
 * operation, each supporting a specific target platform,
 * is a possibility.
 * However this could cause maintenance problems where changes to a
 * operation must be coordinated across multiple source files.
 * This is also inconsistent with the current PVECLIB coding style
 * where a file contains an operations complete implementation,
 * including documentation and platform implementation variants.
 *
 * The current PVECLIB implementation makes extensive use of CPP
 * conditions. These include testing for compiler version,
 * target Endian, and current target platform then selects the
 * appropriate source code snippet (\ref mainpage_sub_1_2).
 * This was intended to simplify the application/library developers
 * life were they could use the PVECLIB API and not worry about
 * these details.
 *
 * So far this works as intended (single vector source for multiple
 * PowerISA VMX/VSX targets) when the entire application is compiled
 * for a single target.
 * However this dependence on CPP conditionals is mixed blessing then
 * the application needs to support multiple platforms in a single package.
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_0_0 The mechanisms available
 * The compiler and ABI offer options that at first glance
 * seem to allow multiple target specific binaries from a single source.
 * Besides the compilers command level target options a number of
 * source level mechanisms to change the target.
 * These include:
 * - __ attribute __ (target ("cpu=power8"))
 * - __ attribute __ (target_clones ("cpu=power9,default"))
 * - \#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power8")
 *
 * The target and target_clones attributes are function attributes
 * (apply to single function).
 * The target attribute overrides the command line -mcpu= option.
 * However it is not clear which version of GCC added explicit support for (target ("cpu=").
 * This was not explicitly documented until GCC 5.
 * The target_clones attribute will cause GCC will create two function clones,
 * one compiled with the specified -mcpu= target and another with the default options.
 * It also creates a resolver function that dynamically selects a clone implementation
 * suitable for current platform architecture.
 * This PowerPC specific variant was not explicitly documented until GCC 8.
 *
 * There are a few issues with function attributes:
 * - The Doxygen preprocessor can not parse function attributes.
 * - The availability of these attributes seems to be limited to the latest compilers.
 *
 * But these is deeper problem related to the usage of CPP conditionals.
 * Many PVECLIB operation implementations depend on GCC/compiler predefined macros including:
 * - __ GNUC __
 * - __ GNUC_MINOR __
 * - __ BYTE_ORDER __
 * - __ ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN __
 * - __ ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN __
 *
 * PVECLIB also depends on many system-specific predefined macros including:
 * - __ ALTIVEC __
 * - __ VSX __
 * - __ FLOAT128 __
 * - _ARCH_PWR9
 * - _ARCH_PWR8
 * - _ARCH_PWR7
 *
 * PVECLIB also depends on the <altivec.h> include file which provides
 * the mapping between the ABI defined intrinsics and compiler defined
 * built-ins. In some places PVECLIB conditionally tests if specific
 * built-in is defined and substitutes an in-line assembler
 * implementation if not.
 * Altivec.h also depends on system-specific predefined macros to
 * enable/disable blocks of intrinsic built-ins based on PowerISA level.
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_0_1 Some things just do not work
 * The issue is that the compiler (GCC at least) only expands the
 * compiler and system-specific predefined macros once per source file.
 * They will not change due to embedded function attributes that change the target.
 * So the following do not work as expected.
 *
 * \code
#include <altivec.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int128_ppc.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int512_ppc.h>

// Defined in vec_int512_ppc.h but included here for clarity.
static inline __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_inline (vui128_t a, vui128_t b)
{
  __VEC_U_256 result;
  // vec_muludq is defined in vec_int128_ppc.h
  result.vx0 = vec_muludq (&result.vx1, a, b);
  return result;
}

__VEC_U_256 __attribute__(target ("cpu=power7"))
vec_mul128x128_PWR7 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}

__VEC_U_256 __attribute__(target ("cpu=power8"))
vec_mul128x128_PWR8 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}

__VEC_U_256 __attribute__(target ("cpu=power9"))
vec_mul128x128_PWR9 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}
 * \endcode
 * For example if we assume that the compiler default is (or the
 * command line specifies) -mcpu=power8 the compiler will use this to
 * generate the system-specific predefined macros.
 * This is done before the first include file is processed.
 * In this case <altivec.h>, vec_int128_ppc.h, and vec_int512_ppc.h
 * source will be expanded for power8 (PowerISA-2.07).
 * So the vec_muludq and vec_muludq inline source implementations will
 * be the power8 version.
 *
 * This will all be established before the compiler starts to parse
 * and generate code for vec_mul128x128_PWR7.
 * This is likely to fail because the we are
 * trying to compile code containing power8 instructions with a
 * -mcpu=power7 target.
 *
 * The compilation of vec_mul128x128_PWR8 should work as we are
 * compiling power8 code with a -mcpu=power8 target.
 * The compilation of vec_mul128x128_PWR9 will compile without error
 * but will generate essentially the same code as vec_mul128x128_PWR8.
 * The -mcpu=power9 target allows that compiler to use power9
 * instructions but the expanded source coded from  vec_muludq and
 * vec_mul128x128_inline will not contain any power9 intrinsic
 * built-ins.
 *
 * Pragma GCC target has a similar issue if you try to change the
 * target multiple times within the source file.
 *
 * \code
#include <altivec.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int128_ppc.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int512_ppc.h>

// Defined in vec_int512_ppc.h but included here for clarity.
static inline __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_inline (vui128_t a, vui128_t b)
{
  __VEC_U_256 result;
  // vec_muludq is defined in vec_int128_ppc.h
  result.vx0 = vec_muludq (&result.vx1, a, b);
  return result;
}

#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power7")

__VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR7 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}

#pragma GCC pop_options
#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power8")

__VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR8 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}

#pragma GCC pop_options
#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power9")

__VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR9 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}
 * \endcode
 * This has the same issues at the target attribute example above.
 * However you can use pragma GCC target if it proceeds the first
 * \#include in the source file.
 *
 * \code
#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power9")
#include <altivec.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int128_ppc.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int512_ppc.h>

// vec_mul128x128_inline is defined in vec_int512_ppc.h

__VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR9 (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}
 * \endcode
 * In this case the cpu=power9 option is applied before the compiler
 * reads the first include file and initializes the system-specific
 * predefined macros. So the CPP source expansion reflects the power9
 * target.
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_0_2 Some things that do work
 * This will require a unique implementation for each platform target.
 * We still prefer a single file implementation for each function
 * to improve maintenance. So we need to separate setting the platform
 * target from the implementation source. Also we need to provide a
 * unique extern symbol for each platform implementation.
 *
 * This can be handled with a simple macro to append a suffix based on
 * system-specific predefined macro settings.
 *
 * \code
#ifdef _ARCH_PWR9
#define __VEC_PWR_IMP(FNAME) FNAME ## _PWR9
#else
#ifdef _ARCH_PWR8
#define __VEC_PWR_IMP(FNAME) FNAME ## _PWR8
#else
#define __VEC_PWR_IMP(FNAME) FNAME ## _PWR7
#endif
#endif
 * \endcode
 * Then use __VEC_PWR_IMP() as function name wrapper in the implementation source file.
 *
 *
 * \code
 //
 //  \file  vec_int512_runtime.c
 //

#include <altivec.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int128_ppc.h>
#include <pveclib/vec_int512_ppc.h>

// vec_mul128x128_inline is defined in vec_int512_ppc.h
__VEC_U_256
__VEC_PWR_IMP (vec_mul128x128) (vui128_t m1l, vui128_t m2l)
{
  return vec_mul128x128_inline (m1l, m2l);
}
 * \endcode
 * This simple strategy allows the collection of the larger function
 * implementations into a single source file and build object files
 * for multiple platform targets. For example collect all the multiple
 * precision quadword implementations into a source file named
 * <B>vec_int512_runtime.c</B>.
 *
 * This source file can be compiled multiple times for different
 * platform targets. The resulting object files have unique function
 * symbols due to the platform specific suffix provided by the
 * __VEC_PWR_IMP() macro.
 * There are a number of build strategies for this.
 *
 * For example, create a small source file named <B>vec_runtime_PWR8.c</B>that starts with the
 * target pragma and includes the multi-platform source file.
 * \code
 //
 //  \file  vec_runtime_PWR8.c
 //

#pragma GCC target ("cpu=power8")

#include "vec_int512_runtime.c"
 * \endcode
 * Similarly for <B>vec_runtime_PWR7.c</B>, <B>vec_runtime_PWR9.c</B>.
 *
 * \note Additional runtime source files can be included as needed.
 * Other multiple precision functions supporting BCD and BCD <-> binary
 * conversions are likely candidates.
 *
 * Then include these files in the Makefile.am list of sources to build.
 * \code
libpvec_la_SOURCES = vec_runtime_PWR9.c \
	vec_runtime_PWR8.c \
	vec_runtime_PWR7.c
 * \endcode
 *
 * Alternatively use Makefile.am rules to specify different -mcpu= compile options.
 * This simplifies the platform source files too:
 * \code
 //
 //  \file  vec_runtime_PWR8.c
 //

#include "vec_int512_runtime.c"
 * \endcode
 * Then add the -mcpu compile option to CFLAGS
 * \code
CFLAGS-vec_runtime_PWR7.c += -mcpu=power7
CFLAGS-vec_runtime_PWR8.c += -mcpu=power8
CFLAGS-vec_runtime_PWR9.c += -mcpu=power9
 * \endcode
 *
 * \todo Is there a way for automake to compile vec_int512_runtime.c
 * with -mcpu=power7 with -o vec_runtime_PWR7.o.
 * And similarly for PWR8/PWR9.
 *
 * \subsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_1 Calling Multi-platform functions
 *
 * The next step is to provide mechanisms for applications to call
 * these functions via static or dynamic linkage.
 * For static linkage the application needs to reference a specific
 * platform variant of the functions name.
 * For dynamic linkage we will use <B>STT_GNU_IFUNC</B> symbol resolution
 * (a symbol type extension to the ELF standard).
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_1_1 Static linkage to platform specific functions
 * For static linkage the application is compiled for a specific
 * platform target (via -mcpu=). So function calls should be bound to
 * the matching platform specific implementations. The application
 * may select the platform specific function directly by defining
 * a <I>extern</I> and invoking the platform qualified function.
 *
 * Or simply use the __VEC_PWR_IMP() macro as wrapper for the function
 * name in the application.
 * This selects the appropriate platform specific implementation based
 * on the -mcpu= specified for the application compile.
 * For example.
 * \code
  k = __VEC_PWR_IMP (vec_mul128x128)(i, j);
 * \endcode
 *
 * This header provides the default platform qualified <I>extern</I>
 * declarations for provided functions based on the -mcpu=
 * specified for the compile of application including this header.
 * For example.
 * \code
extern __VEC_U_256
__VEC_PWR_IMP (vec_mul128x128) (vui128_t, vui128_t);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_1_2 Dynamic linkage to platform specific functions
 * Applications using dynamic linkage will call the unqualified
 * function symbol.
 * For example:
 * \code
extern __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128 (vui128_t, vui128_t);
 * \endcode
 *
 * This symbol's implementation has a special <B>STT_GNU_IFUNC</B>
 * attribute recognized by the dynamic linker which associates this
 * symbol with the corresponding runtime resolver function.
 * So in addition to any platform specific implementations we need to
 * provide the resolver function referenced by the <I>IFUNC</I> symbol.
 * For example:
 * \code
 //
 //  \file  vec_runtime_DYN.c
 //
extern __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR7 (vui128_t, vui128_t);

extern __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR8 (vui128_t, vui128_t);

extern __VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128_PWR9 (vui128_t, vui128_t);

static
__VEC_U_256
(*resolve_vec_mul128x128 (void))(vui128_t, vui128_t)
{
#ifdef  __BUILTIN_CPU_SUPPORTS__
  if (__builtin_cpu_is ("power9"))
    return vec_mul128x128_PWR9;
  else
    {
      if (__builtin_cpu_is ("power8"))
        return vec_mul128x128_PWR8;
      else
        return vec_mul128x128_PWR7;
    }
#else // ! __BUILTIN_CPU_SUPPORTS__
    return vec_mul128x128_PWR7;
#endif
}

__VEC_U_256
vec_mul128x128 (vui128_t, vui128_t)
__attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_vec_mul128x128")));
 * \endcode
 *
 * On the program's first call to a <I>IFUNC</I> symbol, the dynamic
 * linker calls the resolver function associated with that symbol.
 * The resolver function performs a runtime check to determine the platform,
 * selects the (closest) matching platform specific function,
 * then returns that functions address to the dynamic linker.
 *
 * The dynamic linker stores this function address in the callers
 * Procedure Linkage Tables (PLT) before forwarding the call to the
 * resolved implementation.  Any subsequent calls to this
 * function symbol branch (via the PLT) directly to appropriate
 * platform specific implementation.
 *
 * \note The platform specific implementations we use here may be the
 * same platform specific object code we created for static linkage.
 *
 *
 * \subsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_2 Building Multi-platform library binaries
 * To complete the packaging of a multiple platform implementation we
 * need create static archive libraries and dynamically linked
 * <I>Shared Object</I> libraries.
 *
 * \note Here, platform means a specific hardware generation
 * (power7, power8, power9) within a hardware family. For IBM systems
 * this identifies a specific combination of Instruction Set
 * Architecture and processor design (micro-architecture).
 *
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_2_0 Building Static Archives
 * We use the <B>ar</B> command to create static archive libraries.
 * This utility collects any number of (relocatable) object files in
 * to a single archive file.
 * This utility also builds and includes an index of the symbols defined
 * in included object files.
 * As long as the function symbols are unique there is no problem
 * including multiple platform implementation in a single archive.
 *
 * When we use the <B>ld</B> (linker) command to link a program, application
 * provided object files are copied and relocated into to the program image.
 * Symbol references are resolved (bound) to symbols defined
 * within the collection of relocated objects.
 * For any remaining unresolved symbols, the linker will search the
 * symbol index of any provided archives. Matching objects are copied
 * from the archive into the program image, and relocated.
 * The linker then attempts to resolve any remaining unresolved symbol
 * references. This process continues until all the symbols are
 * resolved or all the archives are searched.
 *
 * If the application is statically linking to the PVECLIB archives
 * and using the __VEC_PWR_IMP() macro to qualify application references,
 * The linker matches and extracts only the appropriate platform specific
 * objects for inclusion in the application.
 *
 * \note Once an application is compiled and statically linked with
 * this method, it is bound to that specific platform implementation.
 * Upgrading to an improved implementation required relinking the
 * application. To change the platform target implementation,
 * the application must be recompiled (-mcpu=) and relinked
 * to PVECLIB.
 *
 *
 * \subsubsection i512_libary_issues_0_0_2_1 Building Dynamic Shared Objects
 * Linking to Shared Objects (AKA Dynamically linked libraries) is
 * more flexible than static linking.
 * Shared Objects are separate executable files where search and
 * selection of the specific shared object files to use
 * are delayed until the application is loaded for execution.
 * Similarly, binding of dynamic symbol references to actual data or
 * function addressed is delayed until application execution.
 * This allows programs and libraries to be developed and upgraded
 * independently.
 *
 * This separation of binaries and late binding enables Multi-platform
 * support within a single library package or even a single library.
 * Using the <B>STT_GNU_IFUNC</B> mechanism we can create a single
 * shared object library that contains multiple platform specific
 * implementations and custom <B>IFUNC</B> resolvers for each API
 * function (\ref i512_libary_issues_0_0_1_2).
 *
 * When linking the <B>libpvec</B> shared object file we need to
 * include:
 * - The object files containing platform specific implementations for
 * all supported platforms.
 * - The object files containing the <I>resolver function</I>
 * implementations and <I>indirect function</I> symbols
 * (__attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolver-function"))).
 * - Any additional object files containing platform independent
 * functions and data constants.
 *
 * Applications compiled to use these functions and linked to this
 * shared object will execute on any of the supported POWER platforms.
 * As the application starts up, the dynamic linker will bind these
 * function calls (with help from the resolver functions) to the
 * appropriate platform specific implementation.

/** \brief Vector Unsigned Integer Quadword 4xMxN Multiply.
 *
 *  Compute the 4xM+N quadword product of two quadword arrays m1, m2.
 *  The product is returned as 4xM+N quadword array p.
 *
 *  \note This is the dynamic call ABI for IFUNC selection.
 *  The static implementations are vec_mul512_byMN_PWR8 and
 *  vec_mul512_byMN_PWR9. For static calls the __VEC_PWR_IMP() macro
 *  will add appropriate suffix based on the compile -mcpu= option.
 *  \note The storage order for quadwords matches the system endian.
 *  On Little Endian systems the least significant quadword is
 *  quadword element 0. The most significant is quadword elements
 *  [M-1], [N-1], and [M+N-1].
 *  On Big Endian systems the least significant quadword is
 *  quadword elements [M-1], [N-1], and [M+N-1].
 *  The most significant is quadword element 0.
